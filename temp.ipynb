#Our questions for Hannah
'''
Should a person be able to decide how many units they want to spend or shall we assign the 'costs' of an action? 
Is there a better way of integrating the code for other players without duplicating it over? 
Do we include intermediary steps like bank account and public health insurance as separate milestones or does that make the game too long? 
'''
#Group Decisions 
'''
Can the player advance by pushing a button with their mouse rather than pushing enter?
What is the best way to move people to different segments of the gameplay map? For example, how does a player get stuck in an infinite loop of dice rolls? - see the session on flow 
have a website or distribute game as software? 
'''
#Other ideas - Charu 
'''
We can add some German words as a cute touch - Willkommen, Guten tag etc. 
Sprinkle some 'Did you know?' factoids throughout the game
How can we present text slightly fancier (e.g. ASCII art), title or font pages, or add pictures, if not GUI? 
Charu tasks:Germany documents for Indians + Game research of 2 games recommended + Look at Pygame
Week 2 solutions 
Create a system where 1 player can see how the other players are progressing 
When we switch to multiple players, a player's country could be randomly assigned. Then we may have to nest throughout, with an if P1 = India, then...This would be tedious
We could allow the players to have lives? 
Randomize which type of officer a player gets, pick some german names and give them personalities   
Add some easter eggs
